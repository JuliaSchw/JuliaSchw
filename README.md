# Hello! Nice to meet you, I'm Julia 👋

### Web Designer and Developer

🐣 Currently I'm a student at "Neue Fische" and I'm starting with a Web Development Bootcamp to refresh and strenghten my coding skills. 

👩‍💻 I already worked in some frontend projects the last 1.5 years.

👾 Also I'm interested in synthesizers, especially modular systems and music production.
